1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
    This projects helps understanding the basics of java, even though not as much, but the exercise helps
    more than the project. But from this I familiarized my self more with the basics of java after
    learning python in cs110.


2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.
        Professor, the project one is too hard to understand, as it is the start of us studying java,
        even though we have a python background, it is too hard still.
