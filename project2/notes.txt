   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
        Throughout this project, we acquired knowledge on employing linked lists and manipulating nodes to relocate
   them either to the front or the back of the list. Additionally, we gained proficiency in transferring and deleting
   nodes while preserving the data they contained in a variable.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
